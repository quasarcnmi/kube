# Kubernetes HA Install procedure

This is an isntall of the RKE2 Kubernetes Cluster

I found that this version of Kubernetes install is more straight forward
and flexible.  This apparently is the more secure version of Kubernetes from the SUSE Rancher Company.

I have borrowed some of the functions and shell snippets from [ Jim's Garage (https://youtube.com/@jims-garage)]
